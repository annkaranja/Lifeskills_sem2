	<h1>SAD ROSES</h1>


   <p>Beautiful flowers grew in the next garden. There were lilies and the smell of the flowers was very soothing.
	Maya’s loved the red. Every day she would go to the park and pick a red rose, then she would take it to her mother’s graveyard at the bottom of the garden. Maya’s mother had died six years ago after she was born due to birth complications, and the young girl had promised herself that she would visit the grave three times a week so that her mother would never be forgotten.</p>
	<p>It was on a Sunday afternoon, Maya was picking roses in the park, she saw a boy sitting at the garden, wearing a light blue shirt and a black short. She thought to herslf that it was a school uniform because of the black tie on his neck. The young boy had a red rose in his hand, and he was removing all of the petals from the rose, one by one. Maya ran over to the boy and shouted at him.
	‘Why are you doing that? Why are you tearing the petals one by one off the beautiful flower? Dont you know its wrong?’
	The boy was terrified and asked,‘Why are you getting so upset about it?’
	Maya's tears welled up and finally a drop followed and another and another down her chubby cheeks. Maya said to the boy‘I am crying because I love roses. I pick some for my mother thrice a week, and if you tear them none will be left!’</p>
	<p>Logan felt sorry for Maya and he asked Maya where is her mother was.Maya pointed her mother’s grave at the garden and said,"down there". She sat down on the ground with her red roses and asked the boy for his name. He told her that his name was Logan. Logan added that that he had run away from school bescause he had not finished his Science assignment and the teacher was going to punish him.</p>
	<p>Logan learned that he never saw Maya at school. Maya told Logan that she wondered what it felt like to play in school with friends.Logan asked Maya,‘Do you dislike Science like i do? Maya took a look at Logan’s science book and chuckled and said,"yes,i like it alot, my father teach me about science every day at home.</p>
	<p>Logan told Maya to come to school,  since he noted that Maya was good at it, and she could do it better. Maya was sad since she knew that they were poor and her father could not afford school fees to take her to school.
	In the midddle of no where, a short man appeared in the garden shouting Logan’s name.and the young boy was shocked and he explained to Maya that that was his science teacher Mr. Wonder.</p>
	<p>Mr. Wonder approached the children and asked Maya why she was at the garden instead of going to school. Maya said that they were poor and his father could not afford the school fees.Mr Wonder was sorry.He said,"am very sorry, but i have to go with Logan"
	Logan followed his teacher crying because he knew what was awaiting him.</p>
