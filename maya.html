	<h1>SAD ROSES</h1>
	
   <p>Beautiful flowers grew in the garden. There were lilies and the smell of the flowers was very soothing.
	Maya’s loved roses flowers,she loved the red ones. Every day she would go to the park and pick a red rose,then she would take them to her mother’s graveyard at the bottom of the garden. Maya’s mother had died six years ago after she was born, and the young girl had promised herself that she would visit the grave three times a week so that her mother would never be forgotten.</p>
	<p>One day, while Maya was picking roses in the park, she saw a boy sitting on the garden rose, wearing a school uniform. He had a red rose in his hand, and he was removing all of the petals from the rose, one by one. Maya ran over to the boy and shouted at him.
	‘Why are you tearing the petals off of that beautiful flower? Why are you doing that?’
	‘The boy was shocked,’He asked,‘Why are you getting so upset about it?’
	Maya could feel the tears welling up in her eyes as she said to the boy: ‘I am upset because I love roses. I pick some for her thrice a week, and if you tear them all there will be none left!’</p>
	<p>The young boy felt sorry for Maya and asked: ‘Where is your mother?’
	Maya pointed towards her mother’s grave at the bottom of the garden. She sat down on the ground with her red roses and asked the boy for his name. He told her that his name was Logan and that he had run away from school because he was finding science class too hard.</p>
	<p>Logan learned that he never saw Maya at school because her father was too poor. The young girl told Logan that she often wondered what it would be like to go to school and have friends to play with.
	Logan asked;‘Do you like science? I don’t like science and I will never like it.’
	Maya took a look at Logan’s science book and chuckled as she told him how easily the theory and practical was. Her father had taught her about science every day at home and she loved working out the practicals and very good at it.</p>
	<p>‘You can do science better than me!’ exclaimed Logan. ‘You should come to school.’
	But Maya was sad because she knew that she could not afford to go to school even though she loved the idea very much.
	Suddenly a tall man appeared in the distance. He was shouting Logan’s name and the young boy looked very sheepish as he explained to Maya that this was his science teacher Mr. Wonder.</p>
	<p>When Mr. Wonder approached the children, he asked Maya why she also was not at school. The young girl explained to the teacher that she was not at school because her father was poor and he could not afford school fees her.
	‘I am very sorry to hear that,’ said the teacher kindly, ‘but I must take Logan back to school now because he is not supposed to be in school.’
	Logan reluctantly went with his teacher and they both left Maya alone in the garden.</p>
